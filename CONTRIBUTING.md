# Contribution Guide

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

## How do I report an issue?

Using the [Github issues](https://github.com/gtri/upstage/issues) feature, please explain in as much detail as possible:

1. The Python version and environment
2. How UPSTAGE was installed
3. A minimum working example of the bug, along with any output/errors.

Bug reports and enhancement requests are an important part of making UPSTAGE more stable. If you wish to contribute, then please be sure
there is an active issue to work against. If there is not one please create one.

## How do I put in a good PR?

### Create a Fork

You will need your own copy of UPSTAGE (aka fork) to work on the code. Go to the [UPSTAGE project page](https://github.com/gtri/upstage) and hit the `Fork` button.

### Set Up the Development Environment

1. Get [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh).
2. Use `pixi run -e dev start`

That will give you an editable install in to the `dev` local environment managed by `pixi`. It also runs the lint,
tests, and builds the docs. Any errors from that command should be reported as issues.

### Code Quality and Testing

1. Use `pixi r -e dev lint-fix`, and `pixi r -e dev lint-check` to run style/formatting/typing checks.
2. Use `pixi r -e dev test` to run the tests
3. If you modify the docs, use `pixi r -e dev build_html_docs` to ensure they build.

Code quality is enforced using the following tools:

1. [`pyproject-fmt`](https://pyproject-fmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - pyproject.toml formatter
2. [`ssort`](https://pyproject-fmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - source code sorter
3. [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) - linter and code formatter
4. [`mypy`](https://mypy-lang.org/) - static type checker

### Style Guide

For style, see [STYLE_GUIDE](STYLE_GUIDE.md).

## Making Pull Requests

The valid target for all pull requests is `dev`. Please ensure that your pull request includes
documentation and explanation for its purpose and sufficient documentation to explain its usage.
